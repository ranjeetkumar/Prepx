		'PASSAGE I :\n'+
'At first sight, it looks as though panchayati raj, the lower layer of federalism in our polity, is as firmly entrenched in our'+
'system as is the older and higher layer comprising the Union Government and the States. Like the democratic institutions'+
'at the higher level, those at the panchayat level, the panchayati raj institutions (PRIs), are written into and protected by the'+
'Constitution. All the essential features, which distinguish a unitary system from a federal one, are as much enshrined at the'+
'lower as at the upper level of our federal system. But look closely and you will discover a fatal flaw. The letter of the'+
'Constitution as well as the spirit of the present polity have exposed the intra-State level of our federal system to a dilemma'+
'of which the inter-State and Union-State layers are free. The flaw has many causes. But all of them are rooted in an'+
'historical anomaly, that while the dynamics of federalism and democracy have given added strength to the rights given to'+
'the States in the Constitution, they have worked against the rights of panchayats.'+
'At both levels of our federal system there is the same tussle between those who have certain rights and those who try to'+
'encroach upon them if they believe they can. Thus the Union Government was able to encroach upon certain rights given'+
'to the States by the Constitution. It got away with that because the single dominant party system, which characterised'+
'Centre-State relations for close upon two decades, gave the party in power at the Union level many extra-constitutional'+
'political levers. Second, the Supreme Court had not yet begun to extend the limits of its power. But all that has changed in'+
'recent times. The spurt given to a multi-party democracy by the overthrow of the Emergency in 1977 became a long-term'+
'trend later on because of the ways in which a vigorously democratic multi-party system works in a political society which'+
'is as assertively pluralistic as Indian society is. It gives political clout to all the various segments which constitute that'+
'society. Secondly, because of the linguistic reorganisation of States in the 1950s, many of the most assertive segments'+
'have found their most assertive expression as States. Thirdly, with single-party dominance becoming a thing of the past at'+
'the Union level, governments can be formed at that level only by multi-party coalitions in which State-level parties are'+
'major players. This has made it impossible for the Union Government to do much about anything unless it also carries a'+
'sufficient number of State-level parties with it. Indian federalism is now more real than it used to be, but an unfortunate'+
'side-effect is that India‘s panchayati raj system, inaugurated with such fanfare in the early 1980s, has become less real.'+
'By the time the PRIs came on the scene, most of the political space in our federal system had been occupied by the Centre'+
'in the first 30 years of Independence, and most of what was still left after that was occupied by the States in the next 20.'+
'PRIs might have hoped to wrest some space from their immediate neighbour, the States, just as the States had wrested'+
'some from the Centre. But having at last managed to checkmate the Centre‘s encroachments on their rights, the States'+
'were not about to allow the PRIs to do some encroaching of their own.'+
'By the 1980s and early 1990s, the only national party left, the Congress, had gone deeper into a siege mentality. Finding'+
'itself surrounded by State-level parties, it had built walls against them instead of winning them over. Next, the States'+
'retaliated by blocking Congress proposals for panchayati raj in Parliament, suspecting that the Centre would try to use'+
'panchayats to by-pass State Governments. The suspicion fed on the fact that the powers proposed by the Congress for'+
'panchayats were very similar to many of the more lucrative powers of State Governments. State-level leaders also feared,'+
'perhaps, that if panchayat-level leaders captured some of the larger PRIs, such as district-level panchayats, they would'+
'exert pressure on State-level leaders through intra-State multi-party federalism.'+
'It soon became obvious to Congress leaders that there was no way the panchayati raj amendments they wanted to write'+
'into the Constitution would pass muster unless State-level parties were given their pound of flesh. The amendments were'+
'allowed only after it was agreed that the powers of panchayats could be listed in the Constitution. Illustratively, they would'+
'be defined and endowed on PRIs by the State Legislature acting at its discretion.'+
'This left the door wide open for the States to exert the power of the new political fact that while the Union and State'+
'Governments could afford to ignore panchayats as long as the MLAs were happy, the Union Government had to be'+
'sensitive to the demands of State-level parties. This has given State-level actors strong beachheads on the shores of both'+
'inter-State and intra-State federalism. By using various administrative devices and non-elected parallel structures, State'+
'Governments have subordinated their PRIs to the State administration and given the upper hand to State Government'+
'officials against the elected heads of PRIs. Panchayats have become local agencies for implementing schemes drawn up in'+
'distant State capitals. And their own volition has been further circumscribed by a plethora of —Centrally-sponsored'+
'schemes“. These are drawn up by even more distant Central authorities but at the same time tie up local staff and resources'+
'on pain of the schemes being switched off in the absence of matching local contribution. The —foreign aid“ syndrome can'+
'be clearly seen at work behind this kind of —grass roots development“.'+

		'PASSAGE II :\n'+
		'Pure love of learning, of course, was a less compelling motive for those who became educated for careers other than'+
'teaching. Students of law in particular had a reputation for being materialistic careerists in an age when law was becoming'+
'known as —the lucrative science“ and its successful practice the best means for rapid advancement in the government of'+
'both church and state. Medicine too had its profit-making attractions. Those who did not go on to law or medicine could, if'+
'they had been well trained in the arts, gain positions at royal courts or rise in the clergy. Eloquent testimony to the profit'+
'motive behind much of twelfth-century education was the lament of a student of Abelard around 1150 that —Christians'+
'educate their sons. . . for gain, in order that the one brother, if he be a clerk, may help his father and mother and his other'+
'brothers, saying that a clerk will have no heir and whatever he has will be ours and the other brothers.“ With the opening'+
'Page 7'+
'of positions in law, government, and the church, education became a means for advancement not only in income but also'+
'in status. Most who were educated were wealthy, but in the twelfth century, more often than before, many were not and'+
'were able to rise through the ranks by means of their education. The most familiar examples are Thomas Becket, who rose'+
'from a humble background to become chancellor of England and then archbishop of Canterbury, and John of Salisbury,'+
'who was born a —plebeian“ but because of his reputation for learning died as bishop of Chartres.'+
'The instances of Becket and John of Salisbury bring us to the most difficult question concerning twelfth-century'+
'education: To what degree was it still a clerical preserve? Despite the fact that throughout the twelfth century the clergy'+
'had a monopoly of instruction, one of the outstanding medievalists of our day, R. W. Southern, refers with good reason to'+
'the institutions staffed by the clergy as —secular schools.“ How can we make sense out of the paradox that twelfth-century'+
'schools were clerical and yet —secular“?'+
'Let us look at the clerical side first. Not only were all twelfth-century teachers except professionals and craftsmen in'+
'church orders, but in northern Europe students in schools had clerical status and looked like priests. Not that all really were'+
'priests, but by virtue of being students all were awarded the legal privileges accorded to the clergy. Furthermore, the large'+
'majority of twelfth-century students, outside of the possible exception of Italy, if not already priests became so after their'+
'studies were finished. For these reasons, the term —cleric“ was often used to denote a man who was literate and the term'+
'—layman“ one who was illiterate. The English word for cleric, clerk, continued for a long time to be a synonym for student'+
'or for a man who could write, while the French word clerc even today has the connotation of intellectual.'+
'Despite all this, twelfth-century education was taking on many secular qualities in its environment, goals, and curriculum.'+
'Student life obviously became more secular when it moved out from the monasteries into the bustling towns. Most'+
'students wandered from town to town in search not only of good masters but also of worldly excitement, and as the twelfth'+
'century progressed they found the best of each in Paris. More important than environment was the fact that most students,'+
'even though they entered the clergy, had secular goals. Theology was recognized as the —queen of the sciences,“ but very'+
'few went on to it. Instead they used their study of the liberal arts as a preparation for law, medicine, government service, or'+
'advancement in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.'+
'This being so, the curriculum of the liberal arts became more sophisticated and more divorced from religion. Teaching was'+
'still almost exclusively in Latin, and the first book most often read was the Psalter, but further education was no longer'+
'similar to that of a choir school. In particular, the discipline of rhetoric was transformed from a linguistic study into'+
'instruction in how to compose letters and documents; there was a new stress on logic; and in all the liberal arts and'+
'philosophy texts more advanced than those known in the early Middle Ages were introduced.'+
'Along with the rise of logic came the translation of Greek and Arabic philosophical and scientific works. Most important'+
'was the translation of almost all the writings of Aristotle, as well as his sophisticated Arabic commentators, which helped'+
'to bring about an intellectual revolution based on Greek rationalism. On a more prosaic level, contact with Arabs resulted'+
'in the introduction in the twelfth century of the Arabic numeral system and the concept of zero. Though most westerners'+
'first resisted this and made crude jokes about the zero as an ambitious number —that counts for nothing and yet wants to be'+
'counted,“ the system steadily made its inroads first in Italy and then throughout Europe, thereby vastly simplifying the arts'+
'of computation and record keeping.'+
